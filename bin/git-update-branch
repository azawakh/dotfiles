usage: git update-branch

  After you execute this command, current branch is updated.

  Actually, this command is the alias for 'git fetch origin <branch_name> && git reset --hard origin/<branch_name>'.

Exception:

  As these cases, update-branch doesn't do anything except put it back into the working tree from the staging.

  * There are diffs in your working tree
  * There are changes in your staging
  * There ahead commits in your branch
